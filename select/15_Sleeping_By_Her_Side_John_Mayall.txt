One summer night in Arizona
I saw a girl who I wanted so bad
One lonesome night in Arizona
I saw a girl who I wanted so bad
But I got no chance to tell her
The feelings that I had

We went to the hills with a party
She was falling helpless and stoned
Along through the night of the desert

And I waited till she slept alone
She laid her head on my shoulder
We were sleeping. She was my own

We were all night together a cradle
She was sleeping like a baby child
Our arms together a cradle
She was sleeping like a baby child
Then the sun came up on our desert
She saw me sleeping by her side
