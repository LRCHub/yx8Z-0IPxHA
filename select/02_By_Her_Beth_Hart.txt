She got a poet's spirit
She bums among the clouds
She never stops believing
She only dreams out loud
There's a jackpot in the dresser
She's smilin' in the glass
& If you need to kiss her
Don't forget your stash
'Cause she gives it away
& You're fascinated by her
& She does it again
With simple & brilliant desire
& She gives it away
& You're fascinated by ...
By her - she wears a million colors
There's rainbows on her soles
She got a sign above her
That says I'm never growin' old
You're askin' her to dance
Now she spins a solid white light
She gonna make love to you today
Today & every night
& She gives it away
& You're fascinated by her
Then she does it again
With simple & brilliant desire
& She gives it away
& You're fascinated by
By her by her she may be waiting
'Round the comer of your mind
But still you know
She's there you can feel her inside
So don't forget about the reasons
That brought you her
'Cause she's a miracle.
